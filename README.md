HackedED Beta Website
=====================

Installation
------------

First install `npm`/`node` locally, then run `npm i` to install the required dependencies

Development
-----------

There are only 3 main files to edit to make changes to the website: `index.html`, `main.scss`, and `main.js`. When developing the site, run `npm start` and that will start a webserver which automatically reloads when changes are made. It will also compile `main.scss` into `main.css`
