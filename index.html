                    <p>Hackathons are for designing, creating, and building awesome projects. HackEDbeta is a welcoming event that provides a great learning environment for students from any program of study or school (including our high school friends!)

                    <p>Worried about being in a competition? Don’t be! The competition aspect is optional - if you wish to opt out of presenting your project at the end, you can. This hackathon is all about learning something new and the environment will be extremely laid back. The prizes are sweet, and so is the swag!</p>

                    <p>HackED Beta is one of the annual student hackathons hosted by the Computer Engineering Club at the University of Alberta. On the 18th and 19th of November, we are hoping to push around 60 – 80 students to learn and build amazing projects for 24 hours. The event will be held at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mbrbqXVtKPF2">Startup Edmonton (301, 10359 104 St Mercer Warehouse)</a>.</p>

                    <strong>Why Sponsor</strong>
                    <p>Most hackathons highly competitive in spirit. We believe that such competitive events can bring out amazing work but can also be intimidating for developers just getting started in the industry. Our goal with this event is to create a hackathon with less emphasis on competition and more on learning and trying out new technologies. To do this we are planning on bringing more mentors and hosting workshops throughout the event. We want developers with little to no experience to feel welcome and feel encouraged to learn while still having a bit of competition to push them forward.</p>

                    <strong>Join Us</strong>
                    <p>HackED Beta is a great opportunity for your company to get to see and promote some of the raw talent we have here in Edmonton. We hope you can help us grow Edmonton’s tech community.</p>

                            <p class="question">What happens at a hackathon?</p>
                            <p class="answer">For 24 hours, participants work together in teams of 1 to 5 people to build a project. Teams can work on hardware or software projects. There is no limit on creativity. This hackathon acts as a sort of incubator to your mini projects as it provides a focused time to work on your idea with mentors and workshops to help you along.</p>

                            <p class="answer">Not at all! The hackathon’s purpose is to create a welcoming and supportive environment to learn. That works for any experience level, and any type of learning. The hackathon has plenty of mentors and resources to help you work on your hack. It’s the best place to try something new.</p>

                            <p class="answer">Our hackathon has a competition portion where you will present your work at the end, but this is NOT mandatory. If you do not feel comfortable entering the competition with your work, no worries! At the event you can opt out before presentations begin on Sunday. The most important part of this hackathon is that you come out of it having tried something new.</p>
